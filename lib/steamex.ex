    Steamex is a library for interacting with Steam Auth and other APIs.

    Currently it only supports Steam Auth, but support for other APIs is coming
    soon.

    If you are a Phoenix user, please look at the documentation for
    `Steamex.Auth.Phoenix` for a quick-start guide.

    If you use another Plug-based framework (or just Plug by itself), please see
    the `Steamex.Auth.Plug` documentation for more information.
